//### Section - 5 | Step 10: Spring Web Services Configuration - Generating WSDL

One of the thing is Spring Web Services uses contract first approach. So, we have to define an XML, an XSD and then define
the configuration for Spring Web Services. In this step we will try to expose the WSDL. Spring Web Services actually
created a WSDL for us, we will not have to create it manually. We will name it as /ws/courses.wsdl and this web service
definition is based on the schema which we've already created (course-details.xsd). So, we'll configure web services to use
this schema and generate these WSDL for us.

While configuring WSDL, we need to configure a lot of other things.
1. Port Type - something like an interface (CoursePort)
2. Namespace - This we already have it.
3. XSD (course-details.xsd) based on which wsdl will be created.

We'll start with defining a schema, the way we'd define a schema is by defining another bean of XSDSchema and create a
method coursesSchema(). After defining the schema, we need to use the schema in our WSDL definition. For this also, we
will create a bean and for defining wsdl, we use DefaultWsdl11Definition

That's all the configuration we need to run the Web Service finally!!
We started with:-
1. XML
2. XSD
3. Endpoint
4. Configuration (ServletRegistrationBean, Exposed WSDL definition based on our schema)
5. Run our web service

Spring web services make use of a specific implementation of the WSDL. So, we should add the JAR as a dependency.
Now run the application as a JAVA application.
