//### Section - 5 | Step 12: Implementing a service - Course Details Service - backend with in memo

In the last few steps, we created an endpoint with the hard-coded logic which is not a good practice. So, we are going to
fix it here in this step.

First we will create a Course Java class/object and will fetch it using a service. I would want this course details endpoint
to talk to a service. So, we will create CourseDetailsService and will autowire it in CourseDetailsEndpoint.
    // course details for single course - Course findById(int id)
    // course details for all courses - List<Course> findAll()
    // delete course - void deleteById(int id)
    // update course - void updateById(int id)

Initially, we will create them in memory. We will create a static array list of course and hold them in memory.
Now after making the changes, go ahead and start the application and launch the WSDL.
