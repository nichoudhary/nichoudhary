//### Section - 5 | Step 15: Introduction to different parts of WSDL

The wsdl is available at localhost:8080/ws/courses.wsdl and if you provide this wsdl then they'll know about every detail
on how to call your web service. The common structure of wsdl contains message, portType, binding and service. We can see
the schema in the WSDL, request/response structure.

In the types we are defining the element and in the message we are saying that this is something that can be a request or
a response for one of the operations. The only thing that can be used as request/response element are whatever is mapped as
messages. Once the above are defined, the request/response is mapped to operations using portType. The port type defines all
the different operations and in the operation we map what is the request and what is the response. Port Type is like an
interface as we are defining all the different operations i.e. this web service offer these use-cases/services.

And the binding defines the implementation. How do we really call it? Here the important thing we define are the style and
transport. The transport defines that the service call happens over http. Out of the different styles
(Remote call procedure [RPC] and document), we are using document. Document is most frequently used style of SOAP binding.
So, binding defines how are going to expose our operations.

Last one is service, How are the clients going to use this service? We are saying SOAP address that this is the address at
which the service is available (http://localhost:8080/ws).
