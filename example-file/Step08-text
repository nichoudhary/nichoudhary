//### Section - 5 | Step 08: Configuring-an-endpoint-for-GetCourseDetailsRequest

To tell Spring Framework that CourseDetailsEnpoint is actually an Endpoint, we provide @Endpoint annotation at the
beginning of the class.

The XSD supports the request of a namespace of in28minutes.com/courses and the type (name) GetCourseDetailsRequest. So,
if the request comes with the above namespace and name because if it gets a GetCourseDetailsRequest then only this
processCourseDetailsMethod should be called so that it can take it and put in the request for processing. So for that we
need to tell Spring to process with this namespace and name, we do that by using another annotation
@PayloadRoot(namespace="", localPart="") // localPart is the name (type).

One more thing that this processCourseDetailsMethod needs to do is it would need to take this XML and map it to
GetCourseDetailsRequest Java Class. So, on the request side it needs to take this and convert it into a JAVA object. We
need to tell Spring web services to that. That's done by adding another annotation @RequestPayload and vice-versa to convert
Java Object back to response we would use @ResponsePayload

// @Endpoint
// @PayloadRoot(namespace="", localPart="")
// @RequestPayload
// @ResponsePayload
